### Hey there, I'm [Vincent](https://doerig.dev)👋

I'm an aspiring software engineer and curious developer, currently in my last year of High School. I love to work with JavaScript/TypeScript. Node.js for the backend and Vue as a frontend framework with TailwindCSS. Besides programming, I enjoy working out 🤸‍♂️, swimming 🏊‍♂️, rowing 🚣‍♂️, photography 📷, and many other things.
